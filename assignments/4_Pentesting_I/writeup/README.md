## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (40 pts)

Flag: CMSC389R-{d1gging_f0r_flag5_thr0ugh_1njec7ion}

Command: ;/bin/bash

  Thought Process: Knowing that the service was vulnerable to command injection, I knew that with the proper syntax, I would be able to execute system commands.By utilizing the “;” character, any single command can be executed on the server. Instead of just using simple commands like “cat, ls, cd, etc.”, I decided to launch a new bash shell (;/bin/bash). By launching a new bash shell, I would be able to have full access to the system, allowing me to traverse the entire system to find the flag.

Steps of performing attack
  1. nc 1337bank.money 1337
  2. ;/bin/bash
  3. cd home
  4. ls
  5. cat flag.txt

  Suggested Precautions: V0idcache could implement her script by implementing sufficient input validation, which would prevent malicious users from injecting commands in the script. An example of this would be following bash best practices when using variables, using “${var}” instead of $var.

### Part 2 (60 pts)

Description:  
  This script takes advantage of the command injection vulnerability on the 1337bank.money server, providing an interactive menu which allows users to specify: whether they want to launch a new shell, copy a file, display help, or exit the script.


Options:
  Shell: This option provides the user with an interactive shell to the 1337bank.money web server. Users will be prompted to input valid unix commands that will be sent to the webserver, and the response will be displayed. Invalid unix commands and commands such as “cd” will display nothing back to the user. The shell has root privileges according to the “whoami” command. The user should type in “quit”, in order to gracefully exit the remote shell.

  Pull: This option copies the contents of a file to a local file. The user will be prompted for the exact path of the file on the web server, and a new local file. This is done by performing “cat” on the desired path, taking the output, and creating a new file with the exact information.

  Help: This option displays all of the valid options that this python script supports.

  Quit: Exits the interactive menu

Example Usage:
  1. python stub.py
  2. shell
  3. ls (displays current directory on the remote server)
