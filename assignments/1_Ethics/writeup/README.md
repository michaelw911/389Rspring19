This was done via the [ELMS assignment](). (we'll post an announcement when this is ready!)

### Part 2 (75 pts)

  Upon finding the complex security problems, I would immediately inform my boss, making sure to inform him to the full extent and potential (very likely) safety concerns that would result from the vulnerabilities. Hopefully my direct boss will bring it up to higher management. If my boss fails to respond to my concerns, either out of lack of perception of the many safety issues regarding the vulnerability, or lack of morality, I would take it up the management chain.  Only if the company decides to ignore the risks, I would contact a consumer watchdog. If the issue to relevant enough, the consumer watchdog will pressure the company and the public would eventually become aware of the dangers if not treated promptly. I would not tell the public directly as it would likely cause an immediate public relations disaster and is probably illegal in my contract.

  At this point, I am faced with the dilmenia of potentially losing my job, delaying the project, and protecting the public from a dangerous product, or keep good standing in my company and endangering the public.

  Considering that the sole purpose of my job is to “audit the ECU's firmware for security issues”, I would be bound by my job description to escalate the problem as high as it can go within the company. If my company is unwilling to postpone and there is a clear threat, I would contact a consumer watchdog explaining the risks the vulnerability poses. This information will eventually spread to the public, suggesting that nobody purchases a vehicle with the affected ECU, thereby protecting consumers. By going this route, I would certainly delay the project, negatively impact investor relations, and would probably get fired for ignoring orders from management.

  On the other hand, if I decide to stop pushing for the company to postpone the ECU, there will certainly be less hysteria inside the company in the short term, we would not have to delay the project by 6 months. This would also protect investor relations in the short term. Besides, ECU’s are not connected to the internet, making hard to access by exploiters. However, by ignoring the security issues can pose a public relation meltdown in the future. If somebody does find the vulnerability inside the ECU, patching the security would cause a mandatory, in person, recall since ECU’s are not connected to the internet. If a person were to die/get injured as a result of an exploited ECU, the company’s image would be disastrous in the public’s eye. If I do nothing, I would be considered directly responsible for the cause of any potential harm due to the fact that it was my job to audit the ECU for security issues. Even though my management might not postpone the ECU release, it will still be considered my fault when somebody eventually exploits the ECU.
