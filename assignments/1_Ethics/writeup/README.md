### Part 2 (75 pts)

  Upon finding the complex security problems, I would immediately inform my boss, making sure to inform him to the full extent and potential (very likely) safety concerns that would result from the vulnerabilities. Hopefully my direct boss will bring it up to higher management. If my boss fails to respond to my concerns, either out of lack of perception of the many safety issues regarding the vulnerability, or lack of morality, I would take it up the management chain. Only if the company decides to ignore the risks, I would contact a consumer watchdog if I am legally allowed to. If the issue to relevant enough, the consumer watchdog will pressure the company and the public would eventually become aware of the dangers if not treated promptly. I would not tell the public directly as it would likely cause an immediate public relations disaster and is probably illegal in my contract.

  Considering that the sole purpose of my job is to “audit the ECU's firmware for security issues”, I would be morally bound to escalate the problem as high as it can go within the company. If my company is unwilling to postpone and there is a clear threat, I would contact a consumer watchdog explaining the risks the vulnerability poses.

  If I do nothing, I would consider myself directly responsible for the cause of any potential harm due to the fact that it was my job to audit the ECU for security issues. Even though my management might not postpone the ECU release, it will still be considered my fault when somebody eventually exploits the ECU.
